# CPSC 335 Project 2

Interactive Campus Navigation System using BFS & DFS
The goal of this project is to create a Tkinter-based Python GUI that allows the user to create a virtual map with nodes.
It allows the user to create a paths (edges) which allow the user to choose if the path is accessible or closed

When connecting the buildings, the user specifies the distance and time. 
Given the starting building and ending building, the program uses the Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search to traverse the map to get to the goal

Requirements:
Python 3.10+
Display with at least 1280x720 for optimal layout
